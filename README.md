# GGJ19-Kazoo-All-Devs


**Parentropy**

Our game for the Global Game Jam 2019.


Play as Dominique, an overwhelmed parent, and try to save the house from entropy and mayhem the longest you can ! Then try again and beat your score !!

Click on the events in the house and win the mini-game for more score, or let it go and get closer to the end. Risky decisions shall be valued. 
The rest of the controls are indicated in game.

P.S. : you may need more than 2 arms ;)
